# About PyBookLib

PyBookLib is a two / three part library. Designed to host and get code projects. It is written for mainly Python projects, but it is possible to host other languages as well. PyBookLib is a mixture of PyBook (the client side), and PyLib (the server side). PyBookLib has no affiliations with the existing PyPI projects [PyBook](https://pypi.org/project/pybook) and [PyLib](https://pypi.org/project/pylib). It is a completely separated project, and just happened to be library themed. üòÅ

## Install

You can install the package through the following:

```console
pip install -U pybooklib
```

If you want the latest development version, which most definitely has bugs, run the following:

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/BD103/pybooklib.git
```

## Use

There are a total of three individual packages installed when you download.

### PyBookLib

The PyBookLib package is by far the simplist. It is created as a bridge between the two other packages.
